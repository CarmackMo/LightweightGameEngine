# 2D Game Engine 


## Introduction

This project implements a 2D game engine that based on C/C++ and targeted on Windows platform. 


The game engine implements physics system, timer system, memory allocation system, and user input system. The memory allocation system in this game engine uses the memory allocator I developed in another [project](https://github.com/WaterFriend/MemoryAllocator) . Rendering system and user interface system will be implemented in the future version.

The game engine implements object instances monitor algorithm and runtime garbage collection algorithm using smart pointer algorithm and owner-observer development pattern. 



## 简介

这是一款基于C/C++开发的，Windows桌面平台的2D游戏引擎。  

该项目实现了游戏引擎的物理系统，计时系统，动态内存分配系统。游戏引擎的的内存分配系统使用了本人在另一个个人项目中开发的[内存分配器](https://github.com/WaterFriend/MemoryAllocator) 。该项目除了必要的Window平台库（如WIndows.h），图形渲染库（如OpenCV）和C/C++基础库（如C Runtime Library 和 C++ Standard Library）外没有依赖额外的外部库。

该引擎使用了智能指针和所有者-观察者设计模式来实现了对象实例的实时监控和运行垃圾的动态回收。

在后续的开发中将会为引擎加入渲染系统和UI系统。

## Mathf.h

This file implements various mathematical operations that are commonly used in calculations within the game engine. These operations are implemented as global APIs, allowing users to conveniently access them in the global scope. In current implementation, the operations primarily revolve around: value comparison, random value generation, and validation detection.

+ ### Value Comparison
    Current implementation provides 3 comparison functions with different features and a entry function:
    ```cpp
    /** Compare by checking if the absolute difference exceed threashold "maxDiff". Fastest
     *  performance but lowest accuracy. */
    bool AreEqualEps(float lhs, float rhs, float maxDiff);

    /** Compare by checking if the relative difference exceed threashold "maxDiff". More reliable
     *  than "AreEqualEps()" when inputs are small. Good balance between efficiency and accuracy. */
    bool AreEqualRel(float lhs, float rhs, float maxDiff);

    /** Compare by checking the difference of units in the last place of memory. It will first
     *  try direct comparison and abs-diff comparison, and then try Unit in the Last Place (ULPs)
     *  comparison. Lowest performance but highest accuracy. */
    bool AreEqualAccurate(float lhs, float rhs, float maxDiff, unsigned int maxULPS);

    /** General entry function of above comparison functions */
    bool AreEqual(float lhs, float rhs, float maxDiff);
    ```

    Note that the entry function `AreEqual()` utilizes macros to determine the comparison function to be used at runtime. In the current implementation, if the `USE_EFFICIENCY` macro is defined, the `AreEqualEps()` function will be invoked; if the `USE_ACCURACY` macro is defined, the `AreEqualAccurate()` function will be invoked; otherwise, the `AreEqualRel()` function will be invoked. 

+ ### Random Value Generation
    Current implementation provides 2 random value generation functions:
    ```cpp
    /** Generate a random integer value within range [lowerBound, upperBound). */
    int RandInRange(int lowerBound, int upperBound);

    /** Generate a random float value within range [lowerBound, upperBound]. */
    float RandInRange(float lowerBound, float upperBound);
    ```

    To facilitate the implementation of the two `RandInRange()` functions, a singleton class named `Mathf` is implemented. This class serves as a utility class, providing essential configurations and operations for the functions. It is important to note that `Mathf` is intended to be used internally and is "private" to users. Although users can still access the instance of `Mathf`, it is not recommended for direct usage in application development. All members within `Mathf` are designated as private, ensuring that only specific engine code has access to them.
    
    It is important to note that the range of random numbers generated by the `RandInRange()` function differs between the `int` variant and the `float` variant. This intentional design choice aligns with the behavior of Unity Engine's `Random.Range()` function. For further information and a detailed explanation of the range features in Unity's `Random.Range()`, the following blog is recommended for refereing: ["Why is Random.Range exclusive for integers but inclusive for floats"](https://answers.unity.com/questions/585266/question-about-randomrange.html)

+ ### Validation Dtection
    Functions that perform validation check for input values:
    ```cpp
    bool IsNAN(float val);
    bool IsZero(float val);
    ```

<a id="vector"></a>

## Vector.h

This file contains the definitions and implementations of data structures known as "vector" which are commonly used in linear algebra calculations.

+ ### Features
    - A vector is implemented by a 1-dimensional array, which can be considered as a 1xN row vector or an Nx1 column vector. The current implementation supports three types of vector classes: `Vector2`, `Vector3`, and `Vector4`, representing vectors with size of 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
    - Each vector class is implemented as a template class that only accepts numerical types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `double`, `uint8`, `uint16`...) as template arguments.
    - Additionally, each vector class provides convenient shortcuts for special vector instances, such as the `Zero` vector (0,0,0), the `Up` vector (0,0,1), the `Down` vector (0,0,-1), and so on. These instances are implemented as static constant instances. Since the compiler cannot infer the type of a static instance at compile time, these instances need to be explicitly implemented in advance. The current implementation supports `int`, `short`, `long`, `float`, and `double` types for each static instance.

+ ### Local APIs
    Each vector class offers a comprehensive set of functions and operators that are commonly used in standard calculations, which includes:
    - Type conversion
        ```cpp
        Vector2<U> ConvertTo<U>();
        ```
    - Standard operators
        ```cpp
        void operator+= (Vector<T> vec);
        void operator-= (Vector<T> vec);
        void operator*= (Vector<T> vec);
        void operator*= (T num);
        void operator/= (Vector<T> vec);
        void operator/= (T num);

        Vector<T> operator+ (Vector<T> vec);
        Vector<T> operator- (Vector<T> vec);
        Vector<T> operator* (Vector<T> vec);
        Vector<T> operator* (T num);
        Vector<T> operator/ (Vector<T> vec);
        Vector<T> operator/ (T num);

        Vector<T> operator= (Vector<T> vec);
        bool      operator== (Vector<T> vec);
	    bool      operator!= (Vector<T> vec);

        /* Negate */
        Vector<T> operator- ();
        ```
    - Indexing operators
        ```cpp
        T& operator[] (int idx);
        ```
    - Mathematical operations
        ```cpp
        float           Length();
        void            Norm();
        Vector<float>   GetNorm()
        ```

    There is a remark for the `Length()`, `Norm()`, and `GetNorm()` fuction. For vector instances with integer types, using its original type to perform intermeida calculate will cause data loss, since the result of division and square root might ba a non-integer number. In this case, one solution is to unify the return type to be `float` for integer type instances and float type instances, and let `Vector<double>` instances keep the same return type. However, the attempt to specify a different return type for `Vector<double>` instances using explicit template specialization was failed. In current implementation, all types of instances are using `float` as the only return type.

+ ### Global APIs
    Furthermore, current implementation also provides global functions specifically designed for vector calculations. Noted these global functions are defined whithin the namespace of `Vector::`.
    ```cpp
    T           Vector::Dot(Vector<T> vec1, Vector<T> vec2);            // Supports both Vector2 and Vector3
    Vector<T>   Vector::Cross(Vector<T> vec1, Vector<T> vec2);          // Supports Vector3 only
    float       Vector::Distance(Vector<T> vec1, Vector<T> vec2);       // Supports both Vector2 and Vector3
    ```

<a id="Matrix"></a>

## Matrix.h

This file contains the definitions and implementations of data structures known as "matrix" which are commonly used in linear algebra calculations and 3D mathematical calculations.

+ ### Features
    - The matrix class is implemented using a N-by-N 2-dimensional array. Considering that most 3D mathematical calculations involve square matrices, the matrix class only supports square matrices to simplify program structure. The current implementation includes two types of matrix classes: `Matrix3` and `Matrix4`, representing matrix with size of 3x3 and 4x4, respectively.
    - Each matrix class is implemented as a template class that only accepts numerical types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `double`, `uint8`, `uint16`...) as template arguments.
    - Additionally, each matrix class provides convenient shortcuts to generate commonly used matrix instances in mathematical calculations, such as identity matrix, rotation matrix, translation matrix, and so on. These shortcuts are implemented as static functions.

+ ### Local APIs
    Each matrix class offers a comprehensive set of functions and operators that are commonly used in linear algebra calculations and 3D mathematical calculations, which includes:
    - Type conversion
        ```cpp
        Matrix<U> ConvertTo<U>()
        ```
    - Standard operators
        ```cpp
        Matrix<T> operator+ (Matrix<T> mtx);
        Matrix<T> operator- (Matrix<T> mtx);
        Matrix<T> operator* (Matrix<T> mtx);
        Matrix<T> operator* (float val);
        Matrix<T> operator/ (float val);

        Matrix<T> operator= (Matrix<T> mtx);
        Matrix<T> operator== (Matrix<T> mtx);
        ```
    - Indexing operations
        ```cpp
        /* User can access matrix elements by using following syntex: val = Mat[row][col]
         * The first "[]" is a direct call to this operator, it returns a pointer to the starting
         * address of the specified row array. The second "[]" is a noraml indexing to the array */
        T* operator[] (int row);

        Vector<T> GetRow(int row);
        Vector<T> GetCol(int col);
        ```
    - Mathematical operations
        ```cpp
        /* Calculate the determinant of the minor matrix instead of the entire matrix */
        T Det(int row, int col);

        void        Invert();
        Matrix<U>   GetInverse<U>();

        void        Transpose();
        Matrix<T>   GetTranspose();

        Matrix<T>   ToTransform();
        Matrix<T>   GetInverseRotTrans();
        Vector<T>   TransformPoint(Vector<T> point);

        static Matrix<T> CreateIdentity();
        static Matrix<T> CreateXRotation(double rad);
        static Matrix<T> CreateYRotation(double rad);
        static Matrix<T> CreateZRotation(double rad);
        static Matrix<T> CreateTranslation(Vector<T> vec);
        static Matrix<T> CreateTranslation(T x, T y, T z);
        static Matrix<T> CreateScale(Vector<T> vec);
        static Matrix<T> CreateScale(T x, T y, T z)
        ```

+ ### Global APIs
    Furthermore, current implementation also provides global functions specifically designed for matrix calculations. In order to provide convenient access for uses, these function not included within the namespace of `Matrix`.
    ```cpp
    /* Calculate vec = Mtx * vec; (i.e. column vector) */
    Vector<T> operator* (Matrix<T> mtx, Vector<T> vec);
    /* Calculate vec = vec * Mtx; (i.e. row vector) */
    Vector<T> operator* (Vector<T> vec, Matrix<T> mtx);
    ```

# Utility

<a id="singleton"></a>

## Singleton.h

+ ### Introduction

    This file implements `Singleton` class that serves as a base class designed to convert any derived class into a singleton. The `Singleton` class is implemented as a template class to ensure its wide applicability and versatility.

    Ensuring that only one instance exists in the entire application is a key requirement for a class that is also a singleton. To achieve this, the constructor of the `Singleton` class is set to private, priventing users from directly instantiating a class instance. Additionally, certain class members such as the copy constructor and assignment operator are explicitly deleted to prevent implicit instantiation of the class. It is important to enforce these rules consistently in all classes derived from the `Singleton` base class, to maintain the rule of "one instance globally".

+ ### Features
    + **Pros**
        - **Single instance**: It guarantees that only one instance of the class is created. Benefits the scenarios where only one object should exist to control actions or resources.
        - **Global access**: The singleton instance can be accessed from anywhere in the codebase.
        - **Resource sharing**: It allows multiple parts of the code to share a common resource or state, avoiding the need for redundant object creation.
    + **Cons**
        - **Global state**: Changes made to the singleton instance can affect other parts of the application, leading to potential coupling and unexpected behavior. Making the code harder to test and maintain.
        - **Thread safety**: In a multi-threaded environment, special care must be taken to ensure that the singleton is thread-safe to avoid race conditions and data inconsistencies.
        - **Dependency management**: As the singleton instance is often accessed directly instead of through interfaces or dependency injection, it will be difficult to manage dependencies and introduce coupling between classes.

+ ### Instruction

    The instruction of defining a class as a singleton shows as below:

    - Inherit the class from the `Singleton` class.
    - Optionally, the user may choose to implement the default constructor (a constructor with no parameters) and destructor. If these functions are implemented, they should be set to private access. 
    - It is important to note that only the default constructor should be implemented, and other constructors should be avoided.
    - Functions that could implicitly create instances of the class, such as the copy constructor and assignment operator, should be explicitly deleted.
    - When the application is terminated or the singleton instance is no longer needed, users should cleanup the singleton instance by manually invoking the `Destroy()` function provided by the `Singleton` class.

    Note that the relationship between the "Singleton" class and its derived classes remains a regular inheritance relationship. When creating an instance of the singleton, the constructor of the "Singleton" class is invoked first, followed by the constructors of the derived classes. Therefore, users have the opportunity to initialize members of derived classes within the constructors.

+ ### APIs
    ```cpp
    static T* Instance();
	virtual void Destory();
    ```

<a id="smartptr"></a>

## SmartPtrs.h

This file implements smart pointers and the necessary components commonly used in dynamic memory resource management. These components include `RefCount`, `PtrBase`, `SmartPtr`, and `WeakPtr`.

+ [RefCount](#refcount)
+ [PtrBase](#ptrbase)
+ [SmartPtr](#smartptr)
+ [WeakPtr](#weakptr)



<a id="ptrbase"></a>

+ ## PtrBase

    `PtrBase` is the base class for both `SmartPtr` and `WeakPtr`. It serves as a API contract for `SmartPtr` and `WeakPtr`, defining certain rules for their member function implementations. Therefore, `PtrBase` cannot be instantiated through copy constructor or assignment operations, and its data is set to be "protected". In general, `PtrBase` specifies the implementation rules for constructors, reference increment/decrement, and data accessor functions.

    - ### APIs
    ```cpp
    /* Constructor contract */
    /* API for standard constructor of SmartPtr */
    void StandardConstruct(T* ptr, std::function<void(T*)> deleter);
    /* API for copy constructor of SmartPtr, considering class inheritance */
    template <class U>
    void CopyConstruct(SmartPtr<U>& other);
    /* API for move constructor of SmartPtr, considering class inheritance */
    template <class U>
    void MoveConstruct(PtrBase<U>&& other);
    /* API for alias constructor of SmartPtr, considering class inheritance */
    template <class U>
    void AliasConstruct(SmartPtr<U>& other);
    /* API for alias move constructor of SmartPtr, considering class inheritance */
    template <class U>
    void AliasMoveConstruct(SmartPtr<U>&& other);

    /* Reference count increment/decrement */
    void IncSmartRef() const;
    void DecSmartRef();
    void IncWeakRef() const;
    void DecWeakRef();

    /* Data accessor */
    T* Get() const;
    unsigned long GetSmartCount() const;
    ```
